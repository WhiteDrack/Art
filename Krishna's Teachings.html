            <p><span class="krishna-quote">"This life is like a Dharmakshetra or Kurukshetra"</span> - where man should perform his duties and not just do Puja-Paath or Bhajan.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="teaching-point">
            <p><span class="krishna-quote">"The human body is also a Kurukshetra"</span> - where divine and demonic resolves are at war every moment.</p>

        <div class="teaching-point">
            <p><span class="krishna-quote">"The war of Mahabharata was a real historical event"</span> - which was used by Ved-Vyas to show man the true form of Dharma.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="teaching-point">
            <p><span class="krishna-quote">"Shri Krishna asked Arjuna to stand the chariot between the two armies"</span> - so that Arjuna could see who all were involved in the war.</p>

        <div class="teaching-point">
            <p>Arjuna was filled with great compassion on seeing his relatives in the war and decided not to fight.</p>
            <p>Arjuna's body started trembling, his face became dry, the Gandiva bow started slipping from his hand, and his mind started getting confused.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="teaching-point">
            <p>Arjuna said:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>He did not desire victory, kingdom or happiness</li>
                <li>Those for whom he wanted all this were all standing ready to sacrifice their lives and wealth in the war</li>
                <li>Seeing his Gurus, fathers, sons, grandfathers, uncles, fathers-in-law, grandsons and friends present in the war, Arjuna did not wish to kill them</li>
                <li>Even for the kingdom of Trilok he did not wish to kill them, so how could he kill them for the earth</li>
                <li>We will not get any happiness by killing the Kauravas, because by killing these tyrants we will incur sins</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="verse">"न काङ्क्षे विजयं कृष्ण न च राज्यं सुखानि च"<br>
